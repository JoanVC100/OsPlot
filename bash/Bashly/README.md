Bashly is a command line application (written in Ruby) that lets you
generate feature-rich bash command line tools.

Bashly lets you focus on your specific code, without worrying about command line
argument parsing, usage texts, error messages and other functions that are
usually handled by a framework in any other programming language.

It is available both as a [ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bashly) and as a
[docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dannyben/bashly).
